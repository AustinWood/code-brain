Couldn't get image assets to load on Heroku. Tried manually precompiling. Eventually settled on moving to Cloudinary. Faster implementation, as well as faster servers!

Getting multiline text to render correctly. Started by using dangerouslySetInnerHTML, realized that was not sustainable, decide to use Draft.js

Cursor was invisible on lines without any text.
Found the guilty CSS with binary search. I had written
.null-note-message p span { ... }
instead of
.null-note-message p, .null-note-message span { ... }
so it was being applied to ALL spans, including those used by Draft.js
