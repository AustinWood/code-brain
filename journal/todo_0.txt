### EASY

grow Question <p> with line breaks
allow for testing array equality
rework Navigation state
  > replace `footerType` with `mode`
  > go from study to edit - changes to skeleton linger in currentNote
  > bug: clicking play after editing a note does not go to play mode
  > clicking study advances to next note without answering

####################
### HARD

refactor Note (separate editor note from quiz note)
  > 'run code' and 'edit' icons shouldn't move when clicking 'reveal answer'
Study Algorithm (see todo_1.txt)
