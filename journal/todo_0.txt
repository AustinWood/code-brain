### UI TWEAKS

pop up blank note in index when clicking add
autofocus on title and insert space
add label for 'Question' during edit
cancel doesn't work for adding new note
delete doesn't work for adding new note

####################
### STUDY ALGORITHM

store currentBucket && highestBucket
first time on faces: tooltip -- the key is that your consistent in how you rate yourself. notes dont 'become due'. that's just stressful. you spend as much time each day as you see fit, and we'll make sure that study time is optimized for you.
is it not randomizing? first note always the same

add more seeds
