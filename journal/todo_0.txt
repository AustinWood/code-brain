### ON LOGIN

start at study (thank you, Ryley! )
modal which says <<MODAL_MESSAGE
Welcome to Code Brain.
Your currently reviewing your notes.
Try to solve the problem by typing your code on the left.
You can use console.log to print test cases
etc...
MODAL_MESSAGE

####################
### STUDY ALGORITHM

store currentBucket && highestBucket
first time on faces: tooltip -- the key is that your consistent in how you rate yourself. notes dont 'become due'. that's just stressful. you spend as much time each day as you see fit, and we'll make sure that study time is optimized for you.
is it not randomizing? first note always the same

### SEEDS

allow for testing array equality
add more seeds

####################
### LATER

navigation, just buttons, in the nav bar center display '> dashboard' or 'cd study'
pop up blank note in index when clicking add
'Skeleton' / 'Console' / etc labels highlight on editor hover and self text hover
placeholder text when adding note
hover text for add note
hover for trash/add/cancel icons
change image color on active
flash errors: skeleton/solution can't be blank
smiley footer expands beyond note if screen is narrow
animate '5 Notes Due' button color to entice first time user to click on it. Present a modal first time, explaining what to do. Use a boolean that resets on each login IF username === demo_account
make console text green
change line color to green if starts with console.log
show last output grayed out in console
refactor Note (separate editor note from quiz note)
consistency in hover/selected/bg color/border color across index/nav/note/etc. e.g move ADD to index from nav bar
